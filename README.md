PHPStorm-color-schemes
======================

A collection of the color schemes for PHPStorm. 

### Installing a color scheme
1. Locate your ```.WebIde``` folder. It will show as ```.WebIde60``` or ```.WebIde50``` depending on the version of PHPStorm you are using. We'll call it ```.WebIdeXX```.
    * ```.WebIde``` Locations
      * Mac: ```~/Library/Preferences/```
      * Windows 7: ```C:\Users\<username>\```
      * Windows XP: ```C:\Documents and Settings\<username>\```
      * Linux: ```~/```

2. Add the ICLS file you want to use to your ```.WebIdeXX/config/colors/``` directory and restart PHPStorm to have the theme show in the ```Settings/IDE Settings/Editor/Colors & Fonts/Scheme Name``` select box.
